# Respond With:

* Whatever you want.

---

# Lots of prebuilt Actions

--

* Workflows for 30+ languages

# Or, build your own

## With TypeScript!

### (Or a Docker container)

---

* Think of it like IFTTT for anything on GH
* You build it, runs on GitHub


---

Why better than others?

* Forkable https://github.com/gimenete/github-jest-snapshots/pull/1

## CD

> Mary and Tom Poppendieck asked, ‚ÄúHow long would it take your organization to deploy a change that involves just one single line of code? Do you do this on a repeatable, reliable basis?‚Äù1 The time from deciding that you need to make a change to having it in production is known as the cycle time, and it is a vital metric for any project.

* npm publish https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/master/ci/npm-publish.yml

# Or add some sugar

# Stencil


* Code with TypeScript
* Use JSX
* Reactive Data Binding
* Disappearing Framework

---
# `<joy-con>` is a Stencil Component

```typescript
@Component({
  tag: "joy-con",
  styleUrl: "joy-con.css",
  shadow: true
})
export class MyComponent {
  @State() private initialized = false;
  @Prop() side: "L" | "R";
  @Prop() left: string;
  @Prop() right: string;

  /* etc */

  render() {
    return <JoyConIcon active={this.initialized} />;
  }
}
```

# Your framework exports them

* Angular
* Vue
* Dojo
* React (with a wrapper)

---

# Use them in your apps

* Great as "leaf nodes"
